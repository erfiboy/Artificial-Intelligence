# Genetic Programing
 Due to the complex search space Function Approximation requires, AI techniques has been used extensively to spot the best curves that match the real behavior of the system. Genetic algorithm is known for their fast convergence and their ability to find an optimal structure of the solution. We propose using a genetic algorithm as a function approximator.
